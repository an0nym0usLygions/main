👋 Hi, I’m @an0nym0usLygions. 
👀 I’m interested in cybersecurity, ethical hacking, and online privacy. 
🌱 I’m currently learning about penetration testing techniques and advanced cryptography. 
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source security projects or participate in bug bounty programs. 
💬 A quote I love is "Every journey begins with a single letter, but it's your story that matters most."

I work on CTF Challenges, here are a list of categories I work on:
1. OSINT
2. Cryptography
3. Steganography
4. Web
